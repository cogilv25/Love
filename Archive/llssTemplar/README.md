# L.L.S.S Templar

I created this project for a week long game jam but unfortunately life got in the way and so I wasn't able to spend much time on it. I may return to it at some point if I have time but for now it will exist as an odd little spaceship flying, laser firing... thing... with some nice music! P.S. The music is not made by me it was from a free asset website.

## How to run it

Download [LÖVE 2d](https://love2d.org "LÖVE 2D's Homepage"), extract it then drag and drop the folder containing main.lua onto LOVE.exe. Hey presto, magic zesto, the game will appear before you! Other versions may work but it was made with v11.3
