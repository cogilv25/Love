# LÖVE 2D Projects
Written by Calum Lindsay.

My collection of projects based on the [LÖVE 2D Game Engine](https://love2d.org "LÖVE 2D's Homepage"). Most of my projects get scrapped and never see the light of day but those that do are here. Either in the archive (Most likely to soon meet their doom...) or on display here if they are in current development or have somehow been completed to a reasonable standard in my eyes.

## Procedural Things (procThings)
 
Sometime around about 2016 I stumbled across [this paper](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/lsfp.pdf) and was intrigued so I made a small program (located in the archive section of this repo) capable of generating some of the fractals described in the paper and attempting to create a couple of my own, it was never really intended to be taken further and as such is not very maintainable, quite messy and hard to follow. This is it's successor, which is going to be more maintainable and possibly evolve into a useful tool/program although for now is still more of a toy/proof of concept than a project with a distinct objective.

Completed: WIP


## Lovely Snake (lovelySnake)

I wanted to create a finished game because of my terrible habit of starting lots of ambitious projects but never completing them so I decided to make the good old classic snake game... AND I actually completed it to a point I'm happy with. There are improvements that could be made for sure but it's a playable game so I'm pretty much calling it done unless I have some inspiration to go back and work on it at some point.

Completed: 29/08/2019
